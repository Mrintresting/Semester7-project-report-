# Semester7-project-report-
This is the report of the semester project I did in semester 7 of my undergraduate program. 
The project consisted of reading papers to understand the mathematical framework  presented in the paper  https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03943 . The paper titled,"Deep Learning the Slow modes for rare events sampling" introduced neural network approach  for the problem of finding collective variables for the sampling of Free energy surface.
